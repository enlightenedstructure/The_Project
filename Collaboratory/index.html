<p><strong>6. Collaboratory</strong></p>

<p>"systems intelligence &amp; innovation design lab + global foresight commons (a Wikipedia for Getting *Shift*
  Done)"</p>

<p>This is our backroom playspace. Think of it like the artisan's workshop. If you become a patron of the creative
  process, you get access to the inner workings. Blog posts still being baked in co-creation, book drafts you can offer
  feedback to, and access to a weekly newsletter ("Thought Architecture") which is essentially personal musings by me
  about the creative economy, leadership, innovation, and the joys and struggles of my existence.</p>

<p>Fascinating, i know. <img src="http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?m=1317409745g" alt=";)"

<p>This is also where the private community (the Emergence Collective) works on stuff together. You can check out the
  status of projects, see new projects/business ventures forming in the incubator, and see the bleeding edge tech and
  innovation research we're conducting. Check out sketches and UI mockups that the design team are working on. Peruse
  the code projects by the Hackademy, our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild">hacker guild</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/on_a_global_foresight_commons/">Global Foresight Commons</a> is
  a wiki library of tools, techniques, methodologies, and practices for accelerating The Big Shift. I've been building
  this out with a group for about a month now and plan to open it to the public when it's ready so all can benefit from
  the resource.</p>

<p>Also building out an API &amp; IP Commons with the hacker teams in our community. They'll be able to share code and
  give visibility to each others' projects so they can accelerate their initiatives. We favor open source, but all are
  welcome.</p>

<p>The Collaboratory is essentially an engine of co-creation combined with a Commons. You bring in your community of
  practice, set up shop in your own 'global space' area, and set permissions for what is visible, shareable, or
  private.</p>

<p>The metaphor we've been using to conceptualize it is Storefront / Cafe / Backroom.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Storefront:</strong></p>

<p>This is like the Macy's window from the street. It's your showcase of the "best of" what's inside. Public-facing view
  of your projects and ventures.</p>

<p><strong>Cafe:</strong></p>

<p>This is your shop. Just like stores have rules to enter ("no shirt, no shoes, no service), there are permissions to
  be granted to enter the shop. (ie -- referral via trust network, sign NDA, whatever terms you set. it's your
  space.)</p>

<p><strong>Backroom:</strong></p>

<p>This is the creator's workshop. Deepest level of access permissions. Maybe it's just your core team and your workflow
  management. Maybe it's where you invite potential collaborators or investors to check out your big picture vision. It
  might be a bit chaotic, but it's where the magic happens.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>***intentcast</strong>: participants who want to play. we have 25 so far.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>***intentcast</strong>: someone who can install SQL and Confluence when we go self-hosted.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>***intentcast</strong>: WikiGardeners &amp; Curators for the GetShiftDoneipedia.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>***intentcast:</strong> Sherpas and Guides to be welcoming party give orientation for n00bs in the
  Collaboratory.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p>Also looking for co-creators for white papers &amp; research about organizational transition that we can
  offer to companies to help them ride the edge.</p>

<p>We have one community member, Bernd Nurnberger, who is currently paying monthly for our hosted license for 25 user
  accounts. If we each just pitch in $5/month, the cost is distributed, and we essentially "co-own" our collaboration
  infrastructure. with scale, the price drops.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>***intentcast</strong>: free Atlassian license. Much of what we're doing <a
  href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/open-source-license-request">qualifies as an open source project</a></p>

<p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>

<p>Another thing we're experimenting with is dynamic team formation and developing methods to evaluate and
  strengthen human infrastructure. This emerged from my thoughts about <a
    href="http://emergentbydesign.com/2010/03/09/framework-for-a-strengths-based-society/">a strengths-based society</a>.
  To that end, we've created a partnership with <a href="https://thegabrielinstitute.com/index.php">The Gabriel
    Institute</a> and they are providing us with role-based assessments, which provide measures of <a
    href="https://thegabrielinstitute.com/consulting.php">Coherent Human Infrastructure</a> indicators. Learn more about
  <a href="https://thegabrielinstitute.com/Roles/">the roles in an innovation team</a>.</p>

<p>Taking the assessment and sharing your role is a prerequisite to participating in the Collaboratory.</p>
