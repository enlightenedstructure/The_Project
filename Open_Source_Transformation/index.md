A Renaissance of Transformation
-------------------------------

Open source software and open technologies like Wikipedia have made a huge impact in our world.
Why not use these tools to transform our lives, our companies, our governments and our world?
We have the tools available right now to open up our creative processes to global-scale collaboration --
indeed these industrial strength tools,
which provide the infrastructure for leading-edge open source software,
power this very website, and render every last bit of content and style 100% remixable.

We have seen collaborative projects bearing fruit beyond what we could have possibly imagined
short decades ago.
Now it is time to dream even bigger --
to create a global pubic works infrastructure for the age of collaboration.
We envision a thriving ecosystem of sites dedicated to change, both personal and global.
These sites are part of humanity's "Creative Commons" -- part of our shared wealth.
They can be freely copied, and the copies freely modified.

A powerful leverage point is collaboratively building and continuously improving
transformational systems -- for individuals, for organizations, and for the planet.
Systems that are open source at the software level, open designs at the hardware level,
open intellectual property at the idea level.
Please join us in creating the Open Source Transformation.
