"The Project" is what we are playfully calling
the matrix of enlightened technology projects that is swirling around, 
wanting to meet each other and play.

The purpose of this site is to act as a seed crystal for the coming together of a post-scarcity creativity economy,
and the various existing projects that comprise this movement already.            

Key starting points:

  * [The vision][]: what we want to do
  * [The projects][]: how we plan to get there
  * [The tools][]: how we communicate along the way


  
[The vision]: /How_to_Bootstrap_Creative_Economy_3_0
[The projects]: /Infrastructure_Projects
[The tools]: /Communication_Tools
