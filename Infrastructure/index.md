## Communications / Awareness

what adam and venessa have been working on is some kind of communications / awareness infrastructure for "us" - those people developing various components of The Project - so that it's easy to stay aware of updates, potentials for collaboration, resource sharing, and bootstrapping.

when we are better equipped to help ourselves, it will be easier for us to share the love and wealth with others. 

this kind of "process information exchange" is what i imagine being useful material we populate in the Open Knowledge Commons (OKC), so we can all get more effective/efficient as we share what works and what doesn't. a community of practice.

some current options for keeping each other in tighter feedback loops:

### closed or secret facebook group

since everyone seems to be on facebook, a low barrier to collaborative entry is to start a private group which we all commit to posting updates to and just keep a nice conversation going.

### skype watercooler

not sure if everyone is on skype, but we're on there daily, and this could be yet another channel where we form a virtual water cooler for realtime chat.

### google+ private group

if you don't like facebook, we could create a private google+ group for essentially the same purpose. just depends on where is going to be more 'sticky'. 

### google group mailing list

again depending on how private you want to be, but i started "The Next Net" google group early last year as a communication channel to get geared up for Contact, and there's over 300 people on that list. since 'The Next Net' is like 'The Project', many many people and projects are already in there. we can use that as our mailing list because.... well.... it exists. why reinvent the wheel? and as you'll see from the URL, the intention of the group is "building a distributed decentralized internet" - http://groups.google.com/group/building-a-distributed-decentralized-internet?hl=en

### collaboratory.cc

so this is the confluence wiki that we have. because it's a wiki, it's basically for shared documentation. what i've been building in there is the "Open Knowledge Commons" - an open database of tools, methodologies, practices, and techniques for transformation/transition. also a research library for our initaitives.

#### Rose-Based Assessments for dynamic team formation

i also made a partnership with The Gabriel Institute, who has created these Rose-Based Assessments for dynamic team formation. they call it the Human Coherence Infrastructure. :)  i had a long video chat with the CEOs a few months back, and they are 'our tribe' as well. enlightened hippies who are excited to help us. basically you do this assessment, and you fall into one of 10 main roles in functional teams/organizations. then we can better understand ourselves and how to form teams around specific projects or initiatives. everyone in the collaboratory has taken the test, so we're just on the front end of finding out how useful understanding these roles can be.

if you want, i can have them send you all a link to the assessment. if you come into the collaboratory, it would be great if you would share your roles on your user profile, as we have done. if you don't want to come into the collaboratory, that's fine, and i can still send you the link to the assessments and you can use the information amongst yourselves.

### App Commons or API Commons or IP Commons

adam and venessa were discussing today that once we had a bunch of builders in a common workspace (like the confluence install, though eventually will probably build some other thing), we could also create some kind of App Commons or API Commons or IP Commons or something that addresses the question of how we share code and tools we build, and how compensation works for that. that's obviously a discussion that all of us would have to have together, and we're not quite there yet.

### shared to do lists

* one tool i just discovered that adam and i are going to experiment with is trello (https://trello.com/), a very simple shared to do list. this at least gives us an idea of what we're all working on and the status of those tasks. 

* pivotal tracker is a great tool for agile project management, built for software projects, but broadly useful, especially for super light weight distributed teams -- https://www.pivotaltracker.com/

### Narrow it down: let's pick one or two 

i proposed several communication channels we can utilize - let's pick one or two and see what works. (i'd recommend not doing all of them, b/c we've kind of been experimenting with that, and it's a nightmare. we never know where to look for what kind of information.
